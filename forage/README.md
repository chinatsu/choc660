# forage

my first attempt at a keyboard not using a pro micro or similar... let's see how it goes


## features

- 48 keys
- winkeyless
- arrow cluster
- uses unified daughterboard (s1, probably)

## layout

[keyboard-layout-editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/264eb9b4cfe87a9984ab72605ec59c53)

## plans

- design a case, maybe try to get a gasket mount style going?
- spend way too much money on a prototype cnc'd case
- be sad that things don't work, never work on this again
